# What is this?
This is a library with algorithms and data structures that can be useful
for competitive programming. However they are written in such way that
they can immediately be used (by simply copy-pasting) without too many changes.

## DataStructures

So far includes most simple version of a segment tree.

## NumberTheory

Includes primitives for modular arithmetics.
